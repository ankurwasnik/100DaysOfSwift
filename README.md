# 100DaysOfSwift with @ankur\_codes
## Day 1
I learned about variables, constants, strings, integers, double and boolean data types. I also explored multiline strings and string interpolation and type annotations. 

## Day 2
I learned about arrays, sets, tuples, dictionary and enumerations.

## Day 3
I learned about operators and conditions. \
Operators include arithmetic operators, comparision operators, conditional operators, range operators, switch operator and ternary operator. \
I also explored combining conditions, compound assignment operator.

## Day 4
I learned about loops in swift. I learned to use for loop, why to use _ in for loop, while loop, repeat while loop, skip an entry in loop, exit a loop , exit multiple loops and more.

## Day 5
I learned about functions today. 

## Day 6
Today, I learned about basics of closure which are one of the most challenging part of swift programming. But, once you get in, it becomes easier to write closure and using them in everyday code.
## Day 7
 I learned about closures extending their functionality and writing them in shorthand as possible.
