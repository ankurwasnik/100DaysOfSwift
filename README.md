# 100DaysOfSwift with @ankur\_codes
## Day 1
I learned about variables, constants, strings, integers, double and boolean data types. I also explored multiline strings and string interpolation and type annotations. 

## Day 2
I learned about arrays, sets, tuples, dictionary and enumerations.

## Day 3
I learned about operators and conditions. \
Operators include arithmetic operators, comparision operators, conditional operators, range operators, switch operator and ternary operator. \
I also explored combining conditions, compound assignment operator.

## Day 4
I learned about loops in swift. I learned to use for loop, why to use _ in for loop, while loop, repeat while loop, skip an entry in loop, exit a loop , exit multiple loops and more.

## Day 5
I learned about functions today. 

## Day 6
Today, I learned about basics of closure which are one of the most challenging part of swift programming. But, once you get in, it becomes easier to write closure and using them in everyday code.
## Day 7
 I learned about closures extending their functionality and writing them in shorthand as possible.

 ## Day 8
 I learned about structs. How to create struct, what are property observer(willSet & didSet), computed properties, methods and mutating methods. \
    - Struct is basically the user defined data structure defined with properties & methods to provide functionality.
    - In swift, struct properties can take value depending upon other properties. they are called computed properties.
    - Property observer are functionalities that will be executed before/after modifying the property value.
        - didSet()
        - willSet()
## Day 9
I learnt about more advanced fundamental concepts of struct. This includes getter & setter, access control and static properties.
- Getter & setter 
    - Getter & setter provide ease to assign and read value of struct properties.
- Access control
    - It is very important for programmer to decide which properties should be accessed from outside the struct program. That is, we should not allow important/critical values to be modified by external program directly. We should have access to properties controlled.
    - By default, properties are public i.e, other part of code can modify them. But, we can control access to properties using **private** keyword.
## Day10
I learnt about classes and inheritance. \
- How to create custom class
- Class inheritance
- Method & Property overridings 
- Final classes (blueprint that doesn't change implementaion)
- Classes are reference type, not value type

## Day 11
I learned about protocols and extensions. 
- Protocol 
    - Protocol are blueprint which tells what properties and methods will a data type confront to.
    - Protocol do not contains method implementation.
    - They are somewhat similar to interfaces in Java programming language.
- Extension
    - Extension are used to add functionality to the existing data types.
    - You can add computed properties and method implementations in extensions.
- Protocol Extensiions ðŸš€
    - This is exiting part of which combines concepts of protocol and extensions.
    - Protocol extensions means adding functionalities(computed properties and method implementations) for the methods we specify in protocols. 
    - Also, it gets available to all the data types which confronts to protocols which are extended immediately.
    - This makes life easy
    - Using protocols and extension for writing programs is also knowsn as POP(protocol oriented programming).
